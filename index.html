            	<p>A) If a customer calls and all the recipients are busy attending other calls, you can select the option for the customer to hear a hold tune for a certain time after which they will be asked if they want to record a message and place a call-back request. If the customer leaves a call back request, the Mobile Business Connect will store this and make an automated outbound call to an available recipient and play the message followed by a prompt to make an outgoing call back to the customer that left the voice message.</p>

            	<p>A) When you sign up for the service, your account manager will create a user account for you or anyone in your company that you designate as the admin in Mobile Business Connect platform. This is a web based portal where the admin will login using the user credentials. This is a self-service portal which can also be used for setting up bulk message broadcasts.</p>

            	<p>A) You can setup the IVR for your Single Robi number in the MBC platform depending on your requirements. This does not mean that you have to have an IVR setup for your Single Robi number. You can choose to skip the IVR and let your customers hear the ringing tone until they are connected to an available recipient.</p>

            	<p>A13) The incoming call from a customer will be handled by the system and routed to an available recipient after checking which recipient is free to take the call.

            	<p>A) Yes, the availability of the recipients can be set in the MBC portal. The recipients can be routed calls from the customers only during their availability hours. Beyond availability hours recipients can make and receive calls to their friends, families and others just like a normal mobile number.</p>
